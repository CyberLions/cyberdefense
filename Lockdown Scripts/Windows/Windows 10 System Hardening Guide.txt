Computer Management
* Check local users and groups

Misc.
* Uninstall Internet Information Services or Internet Information Services Hostable Web Core from hosts
* Enforce policies that restrict admins from accessing web browsers/email/etc.
* A/V installed and up to date
* Enable disk encryption like BitLocker
* Windows Updates
* Disable Remote Assistance/RDP if able


Data Execution Prevention Check
* Check first
   * Verify the DEP configuration.
   * Open a command prompt (cmd.exe) or PowerShell with elevated privileges (Run as administrator).
   * Enter "BCDEdit /enum {current}". (If using PowerShell "{current}" must be enclosed in quotes.)
   * If the value for "nx" is not "OptOut", this is a finding.
* Fix if needed
   * Suspend BitLocker if needed
   * Open a command prompt (cmd.exe) or PowerShell with elevated privileges (Run as administrator).
   * Enter "BCDEDIT /set {current} nx OptOut". (If using PowerShell "{current}" must be enclosed in quotes.)
   * "AlwaysOn", a more restrictive selection, is also valid but does not allow applications that do not function properly to be opted out of DEP.
   * Control Panel > System > Advanced System Settings > Settings (under performance) > Data Execution Prevention > “Turn on DEP for all programs and services except those I select:”
